# CareerPathFhe

**CareerPathFhe** is a privacy-preserving career development platform that uses **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to provide personalized career path recommendations ‚Äî without exposing users‚Äô sensitive personal data.  

The system securely analyzes each user‚Äôs encrypted **skills**, **interests**, and **career history** to suggest potential job transitions, educational paths, and professional growth opportunities.  
All computations are performed directly on encrypted data, ensuring that no party ‚Äî including the platform operator ‚Äî ever gains access to unencrypted user profiles.

## Overview

Career development platforms today often collect vast amounts of personal information, from work experience and education to psychometric assessments.  
While personalization requires data, most existing solutions **sacrifice privacy** in exchange for insight. Users must trust opaque algorithms with intimate career details, risking misuse or data exposure.

**CareerPathFhe** changes that equation.

By integrating **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, it enables computation on encrypted data. The system can **analyze, compare, and predict** career trajectories **without ever decrypting** a single user record.  
This means users can receive personalized recommendations ‚Äî privately, securely, and mathematically verifiably.

---

## Motivation

Traditional recommendation systems face several key issues:

- **Privacy Trade-Off** ‚Äì Career platforms store and analyze plaintext user data.  
- **Profiling Risks** ‚Äì Sensitive details like job changes or salary expectations may be misused.  
- **Data Centralization** ‚Äì Aggregated datasets create attractive targets for breaches.  
- **User Distrust** ‚Äì Professionals hesitate to share full histories due to fear of exposure.

**CareerPathFhe** directly addresses these issues:

- Uses **FHE** to process data without ever decrypting it.  
- Keeps data ownership with the user.  
- Enables privacy-preserving analytics at scale.  
- Builds transparent trust through encryption, not policy.

## Core Features

### üîê Encrypted Career Profiles
- User profiles (skills, experience, interests) are encrypted locally before submission.  
- The platform stores only ciphertext ‚Äî not readable data.  
- No administrator or analyst can view or reconstruct user information.

### üß† FHE-Based Recommendation Engine
- The recommendation engine computes similarity and growth metrics homomorphically.  
- It can determine which career paths align with a user‚Äôs encrypted skill vector.  
- Output recommendations remain encrypted until decrypted locally by the user.

### üóÇÔ∏è Personalized Path Planning
- Suggests next-step roles, learning opportunities, or certifications.  
- Recommendations are ranked by encrypted relevance scores.  
- User feedback (e.g., acceptance or rejection of suggestions) is integrated securely into future computations.

### üåê Collective Intelligence Without Exposure
- Aggregates encrypted career data to infer broader market patterns.  
- Enables industry-level insight generation without accessing any plaintext data.  
- Organizations can analyze encrypted trends (e.g., emerging skills) securely.

### üí¨ Secure Feedback and Evaluation
- Users can provide encrypted ratings about recommendation accuracy.  
- The system adjusts its internal models without knowing who rated or what they rated.

## Why FHE Matters in Career Recommendation

Traditional recommendation systems rely on plaintext analysis, which inherently exposes sensitive career and behavioral data.  
FHE makes it possible to perform complex analytics **under encryption**, offering both personalization and confidentiality.

| Problem | Without FHE | With FHE |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Data Exposure | Raw resumes and skill sets stored in plaintext | All data encrypted end-to-end |
| Trust Model | User must trust the platform | No trust required ‚Äî privacy enforced cryptographically |
| Model Transparency | Risk of biased profiling | Encrypted auditability and fairness metrics |
| Collaboration | Limited due to privacy constraints | Secure data sharing and model fusion under encryption |

By removing the need for decryption, FHE transforms how human resources technology can serve users ‚Äî with **mathematical privacy guarantees** rather than institutional promises.

---

## System Architecture

The CareerPathFhe system consists of several modular layers, each designed for privacy-preserving computation:

### 1. User Layer
- Users encrypt their profile data locally using a public FHE key.  
- Encrypted skills, interests, and histories are uploaded to the platform.  
- Private decryption keys remain solely with the user.

### 2. Encrypted Processing Layer
- Executes recommendation algorithms on encrypted vectors.  
- Performs operations like:
  - Encrypted cosine similarity for skill matching  
  - Encrypted clustering for career trajectory grouping  
  - Encrypted regression for growth prediction  
- All intermediate results remain encrypted.

### 3. Model Adaptation Layer
- Integrates encrypted user feedback to refine models.  
- Continuously improves recommendation accuracy under encryption.  
- Employs differential noise injection for added privacy assurance.

### 4. Decryption & Insight Layer
- Users decrypt only the final recommendations.  
- The decrypted output includes ranked suggestions, training paths, or possible next roles.  
- No decrypted data is ever transmitted back to the platform.

## User Experience Flow

1. **Profile Creation**  
   Users fill out career data locally (skills, job history, goals). The system encrypts it instantly.  

2. **Data Upload**  
   The encrypted profile is stored on the platform. No one can see its contents.  

3. **Encrypted Recommendation Computation**  
   The FHE engine analyzes the encrypted data and generates encrypted recommendation results.  

4. **Local Decryption**  
   The user decrypts the personalized recommendations locally and views possible career paths.  

5. **Encrypted Feedback**  
   The user submits encrypted feedback about the suggestions‚Äô relevance, enhancing model accuracy.

## Security and Privacy Design

CareerPathFhe follows **privacy-by-design** principles, with security embedded into every component.

### Key Privacy Guarantees

- **Zero Plaintext Processing** ‚Äì All computations happen on encrypted data.  
- **Key Ownership** ‚Äì Only the user controls decryption keys.  
- **Isolation of Data** ‚Äì No shared plaintext database exists.  
- **Mathematical Trust** ‚Äì Privacy enforced through cryptography, not policy compliance.  
- **Auditable FHE Workflows** ‚Äì Operations can be verified without revealing data content.

### Threat Mitigation

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|
| Data breach | All records encrypted with FHE |
| Insider access | No plaintext available for viewing |
| Profiling or discrimination | FHE prevents model from accessing identity or demographics |
| Model inversion attack | Encrypted computation prevents reconstruction of user input |
